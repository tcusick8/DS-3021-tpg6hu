## Problem Focus Questions

# Q1: What problems are facing the organization? 
### There are billions of dollars being wasted every year within the US education system on education software

# Q2: What is the target variable and what type (reg or class) of solution are they developing? 
### The target variable is which software program would be most sucessful for each school. The variable type would be
class, because the model is determining which software is best for each school 

# Q3: How would they know the solution was working (business metric)? 
### If there was less 'wasted' money the solution would be working. This would be determined by
less spending on multiple softwares while having increasing test scores - and positive teacher reviews. 

# Q4: What other issues might the team be facing?
### The dataset is relatively small, and it includes biases and noise because of subjective survery responses and varying opinions 


## Data to Concept Questions

# Q1: How difficult is the data to gather? 
### The data would be semi difficult to gather due to the fact that multiple different school districts
and multiple schools within each district would need to be willing to contribute in order to have 
a more holistic and well rounded data set. The dataset would need representation from multiple variable, 
one of which being data from rural, suburban, and urban areas. 

# Q2: Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts? 
### The target is difficult to measure because the measure of success is subjective. Teacher reviews are subjective,
and even test scores are not always good measures of a students learning or understanding of a specific topic. 
Additionally, school districts are all of varying sizes, ie in New York City District 6 there are 38 schools,
where as in Cresskill NJ there are 4 schools in the entire district. So to group or stratify would pose as 
quite the hurdle.  


# Q3: What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept?
### To start, I would say any progress even if minimal would be awesome. This is a huge task and success might
stem just from chipping away at it. As more data is collected and results funnel in the model would
become more and more accurate leading to better overall results.
